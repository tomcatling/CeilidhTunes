# UCLU Ceilidh Band Tunebook (ABC)

ABC files were mostly checked and written using EasyABC, many copied from [thesession.org](http://thesession.org/) or [abcnotation.com](http://abcnotation.com/).

Other .abc programs should give similar results.

The tunebook can be built by running generate_tunebook.sh. This requires bash 4+, abc2abc and pdflatex with the [abc package](https://ctan.org/pkg/abc?lang=en) installed. The local abc.sty in the ./tex/ directory has been edited to allow code control of newlines. The command takes an optional argument to transpose the output - e.g. '''./generate_tunebook.sh 2''' will generated a tunebook transposed by +2 semitones.

If you want to include a tune in a set you should add the filename (without the .abc suffix) and the set name to the array declarations at the start of generate_tunebook.sh. The abc file must exist in the ./abc/ directory and the set must be included in the main LaTeX file (./tex/build.tex).

Mp3 files can be generated by running generate_mp3s.sh. This requires bash, abc2midi, timidity and ffmpeg. These will be created for any .abc file in the ./abc/ directory.
